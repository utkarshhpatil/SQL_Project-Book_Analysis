# SQL_Project-Book_Analysis
The project provides insights into various aspects of the book database, including book titles, authors, and publication years. It aims to answer questions such as:

Which are the most popular books and authors?
What are the trends in book publishing over time?
Which genres are the most popular ?
The project includes an SQL script file with all the queries used for data analysis.

Why the project is useful
The project is useful for anyone interested in learning SQL for data analysis and gaining insights from a real-world dataset. The project can serve as a starting point for further exploration of the Books database, and as a reference for SQL techniques and functions used for data analysis.

How users can get started with the project
Users can get started with the project by cloning the repository. They will need to have PostgreSQL installed and a copy of the Books database to run the queries and replicate the analysis.
